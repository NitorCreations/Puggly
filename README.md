Easy to configure logging filter for servlet containers. Just create an instance of `LoggingFilter`, configure which messages to log and how to conditionally modify the logged content and you are done. All done with few lines of pure Java.

## Usage

    LoggingFilter filter = new LoggingFilter();
    
    // do not log requests to health probe
    filter.registerSkipCondition(requestUriContains("/health");
    
    // if the response is json, then pretty print it
    filter.registerTransform(hasResponseContentType("application/json"), prettyPrintJsonResponseBody());

Besides the helpers like `requestUriContains` that you can find from `Conditions` and `Transforms` classes, you can easily write your own transformations and conditions with Java 8 lambda expressions:

    // let's only log error messages
    filter.registerSkipCondition(exchange -> exchange.response.status == 200);

When you have your `LoggingFilter` configured the way you want it, just introduce it to your servlet container.

### With Spring

    @Bean
    Filter myLoggingFilter() {
        LoggingFilter filter = new LoggingFilter();
        // .. configure here like you want it
        return filter;
    }
